## üìñ Usage Guide

### Initial Setup with Sample Data

1. **Add Sample Data**
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/add-listing`
   - You'll see a confirmation message that sample data has been added

2. **View All Listings**

   - This displays all listings in the database

3. **Clear All Data** (if needed)
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/delete-all`
   - This removes all listings from the database


###  Production Dataset Generation & Loading

1. Raw Data Source

To download the production dataset, go to https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ and search for Toronto. 

- Download the Detailed Listings data from https://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/on/toronto/2025-06-09/data/listings.csv.gz (File name - listings.csv.gz)
- Download the Reviews.csv file from https://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/on/toronto/2025-06-09/visualisations/reviews.csv (File name - reviews.csv)
- Download the Neighbourhoods.csv file from https://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/on/toronto/2025-06-09/visualisations/neighbourhoods.csv (File name - neighbourhoods.csv)

2. Transformation & Loading Script

We provide a single ingestion module that reads those three CSVs, parses & validates every field, and bulk-loads into all six tables in the correct order:

scripts/data_ingestion.py will:

- Check if Host & Listing tables are empty
- Read prod_data/listings.csv, reviews.csv, neighbourhoods.csv
- Parse dates, prices, booleans, percentages
- Insert into Host, Listing, Neighbourhood, ListingAmenity, Review, Availability using ON CONFLICT to avoid duplicates

All of the features below have been implemented and tested for production dataset.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Issues
- **Error**: `could not connect to server`
  - **Solution**: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
  - Check if the port 5432 is available
  - Verify database credentials

#### Import Errors
- **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError`
  - **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Check if virtual environment is activated

#### Flask App Not Starting
- **Error**: `Address already in use`
  - **Solution**: Kill existing processes on port 5000 or use a different port
  - On Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`
  - On macOS/Linux: `lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9`


### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console/terminal for error messages
2. Verify database connection and table existence
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
4. Check if the Flask server is running on the correct port

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-feature`)

## üìù Notes

- This application uses PostgreSQL as the database backend
- All prices are in Canadian Dollars (CAD)
- The application is designed for educational purposes as part of CS 348 taught at the University of Waterloo.
- Production data includes various property types and neighborhoods extracted from actual airbnb production dataset.

## üîí Security Considerations

- Ensure database credentials are not exposed in public repositories
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate all user input before database operations
- Implement proper error handling for production use
